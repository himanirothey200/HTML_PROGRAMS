        experience, and a person needs to have this experience in his/her life. College Life exposes us to whole new experiences which we always 
        dream of experiencing after our school life.Lucky are those who get the chance to enjoy their college life, as many people don't get this 
        chance due to their circumstances or financial issues.For every person, College Life has a different meaning.While some people spend their
        college life partying with friends, others become more cautious about their careers and study hard.Whatever the way, every individual enjoys 
        their college life and always wishes to relive that time once it is over.</p>

        it’s the college trips. One of the best things in college life is field trips where they can go out and have 
        quality time with their friends and teacher and learning experience.</p>
